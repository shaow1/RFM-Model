# RFM-Model

R stands for Recency, F stands for Frequency and M stands for Monetory. This model can help us find valuable customers.

This model will read data from CSV file which contains information about summary for different customers. The key information we need for this model are how long customers had been member, the total amount they spend in time period we want to analyze and how long customers had been an active member( ie making purchase).
